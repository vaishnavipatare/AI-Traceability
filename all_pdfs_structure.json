A project report is not quite\nthe same as a technical report2, however it should show the same level of care and attention to\ndetail.\nThis document was written to provide a few pointers about what I look for in a project report,\nand some tips for writing these documents using Microsoft Word. It is written in the form it\nrecommends, and contains examples of both good and bad styles. It is intended for\nundergraduate project students, and post-graduate students in their first year. It assumes a\nreasonable familiarity with Microsoft Word (although not at the level of an expert user), and a\nreasonable grasp of English grammar.\nThis introduction chapter introduces this document, and contains some advice about writing\nreports for me to review.\n(You've now read the first couple of paragraphs of the introduction, and you should have a\ngood idea of what's in the rest of the document, whether you have the necessary background to\nbe able to understand it and might find it useful, and what's in the rest of this introduction\nchapter. All reports should start like this.)",

            "text": "I've been supervising undergraduate projects for a few years now, and I find myself constantly\ngiving the same talk to different students. This is getting a bit tedious, and I find I often forget\nto mention something to one student, and a report then gets handed in at the end which isn't as\ngood as it could be. So I decided to put down my thoughts (or at least those of them that I\nremember as I write this) and distribute this document. Other thoughts will no doubt occur to\nme later, and this document will be updated as I remember them.\nPlease note that there is no accepted standard for project reports. Different supervisors will\nhave different opinions and preferences about style; in some cases this document merely\ndescribes my preferences and opinions (I will try to make clear when this happens). Any\nstudent reading this document would be well advised to talk to his or her other supervisor as\nwell, and attempt to write a document to satisfy us both.\nDistributing this report written in Word has two additional benefits: it allows me to give\nexamples of what I regard as good (and occasionally bad) styles, and it gives me the chance to\ndistribute a sample style gallery that might be of some use. (If you don't know what a style\ngallery is, look it up under Microsoft Word help.)\n2 At least, I don’t think it’s quite the same thing. This is one of those points on which there is no agreement here,\nsome people may tell you that a project report is a technical report.\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n4\nVersion 6"

            "text": "This is important, I want everyone to read this, so I’ll put it here. Strictly speaking you could\nargue that this section should be placed in the body of the report since it is not an introduction\nto anything that is discussed in more detail later, but since it’s short I can get away with it.\nI am happy to read draft copies of a report before submission. However, I am not happy to\nread slightly different versions of the same chapter over and over again, and I won’t have time\nto read anything if I am presented with a large document only a few days before the deadline.\nI have come up with a few rules for how this can best work for both of us:\n1) Run all chapters through a spelling and grammar checker before they get to me, and take\nnote of the advice provided. This is particularly important if English is not your first language.\nIf the grammar and spelling are so poor that I have difficulty in understanding what you are\ntrying to say, then be prepared to have the document returned. I’m afraid I don’t have the time\nor experience to teach English as a foreign language. (There are a lot of on-line grammar\ntutorials on the Internet, which you may benefit from, and other help is available in the\nUniversity;\nin\nparticular\ncontact\nthe\nUniversity’s\nWriting\nCentre\nhttps://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/skills/writing-centre/ for more advice.)\n2) Send me individual chapters one at a time, as soon as they are complete (or as soon as you\nwant some comments on them). This minimises the amount of reading I have to do at the end\nof the projects, and I hope will encourage you to write as you go along (which always a good\nidea).\nSadly, despite my best advice, every year some students leave their writing up to the last few\nweeks, then present me with a large document to review at the last minute. They are then\ndisappointed when I don’t have time to do this.\nI schedule the time to look at one chapter (or about 15 pages, whichever is shorter) every two\nweeks for each project student I have. At busy times, I will operate a queue system. I’m sorry\nabout this, but I really don’t have time to do anything more; and this rule will enable me to be\nfairer with the amount of help I can offer to different students.\n3) If you are sending me a chapter for the second time, then please make it clear where the\nchanges have been made, so I don’t have to read through everything again. (Try turning on\n‘Track Changes’ in Word, or do a comparison of the current version with the last version I\nlooked at, then mark the new sections, perhaps using colour.)\n4) If English is not your native language, it is almost certain that there will remain a lot of\ngrammatical and usage points which the computer’s grammar checker will not pick up.\nExperience has suggested that the best thing is to leave these until the end, and then for a native\nEnglish speaker to go through the document once to correct the grammar. It is better if this\nperson has not been involved with the project, so they don’t get too bored."

            "page_number": 6,
            "text": "The two most important things to do at the start: make a plan about how and when the report\nwill be written, and find out who your target audience is.\nAs far as the target audience is concerned: for the case of an undergraduate project report you\nshould be writing for any of your fellow students who are doing a completely different project.\nThis means you can assume any knowledge covered in the core courses, but not in any of the\noption modules. In the case of a first-year post-graduate report you are writing for someone\nwith the core knowledge of an electronic engineer, but no knowledge about your particular\nsubject area.\nThere is an exception to this rule, which occurs when the academic supervisor who has been\nassigned to you knows nothing about your subject area, not even what is taught in the core\ncourses (for example, in my case, this would happen when the project concerns\nnanotechnology, as I have no background in the subject area). It's always a good idea to check\nwith your academic supervisors (or whoever else might be reading the report) what their\nbackground is. In the case of a project about nanotechnology, I would appreciate an appendix\nwith an introduction to any concepts covered in the nanotechnology option modules which are\nnecessary to understand the main body of the report. (An appendix is an ideal place for\ninformation that only some of the readers of the document will require.)\n2.2\nPlanning and Top-down versus Bottom-up\nIn terms of how to write the report, just as with computer programs, reports can either be written\ntop-down (start with a list of chapter headings, then add the sub-headings, then write each\nsection individually); or bottom-up (just start writing, and then fit a structure around what\nyou've come up). And just like with computer programs, the best results usually come from a\ncombination of the two approaches. Top-down ensures that you don't leave any important\nsections out; bottom-up allows you to write freely, without thinking about what you should be\nsaying, and a more fluent and readable style can emerge.\nAnd please do write in a fluent, readable style. This isn't a technical report intended for\npublication to impress a client, this is a document that will be read by an academic over a\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n7\nVersion 6\nweekend, when he's probably got about seven others to read as well, and a dry ‘academic’ style\ncan be tedious to a point beyond the ability of the brain to tolerate. (This is one of my personal\npreferences: other academics may prefer a more formal, dryer style. I see no reason why\ntechnical documents should not be a joy to read; and I wish many more of them were.)\nIn terms of planning: as soon as you have an idea of what the project document is likely to\ncontain, I would recommend writing a top-down structure and setting a timescale for when\neach section will be completed. Any plan you come up is almost certain to change as the\nproject progresses, but it’s better to have a plan and change it than not to have a plan at all.\nThen, up to the last three or four weeks, I’d recommend working in a bottom-up style, just\nwriting about whatever interesting things have been going on at the time, and your current\nthoughts. As the project nears completion, these bits of writing can be fitted into the top-down\nstructure, and any gaps identified. It’s an iterative process (the top-level plan often changes\nwhen you find there’s very little to say about something), but I would strongly recommend\nmanaging the process, rather than just hoping things will fit together at the end."

            "text": "You have been writing as you go along, I trust, even if it’s just keeping a detailed lab-book?\nThis is one of the most important things. Leaving all the writing up to the end never results in\na good report. This reflects one of the key differences between project reports and technical\nreports: a technical report is concerned with what has been done and what the results were; a\nproject report is more concerned with how you did it. It’s similar to the difference between\ndescribing the destination and describing the journey. Remember, we are trying to give you a\nmark for all the work you did throughout the project (including the problems, bugs and dead\nends) on the basis of a single document handed it at the end. In fact, we're more interested in\nthe problems and bugs (and how you dealt with them) than in the final result.\nLeave all the writing to the end, and you will forget about some of the more frustrating bugs\nyou found, the irritating problems you had, and all the things you tried before you finally found\na solution. Yet these attempts, ideas and frustrations are exactly what we want to read about.\nThere are marks available for having inventive ideas and problem solving, but we need\nevidence to award these marks: please let us give them to you.\nThis is also one of the benefits of sending weekly emails with current progress, issues and\nconcerns. They can be used as a memory-jogger if the relevant sections of the report are not\nbeing written up as you go along. Another benefit is that they provide a diary of events that\ncan be used to plot progress against the project plan."

An abstract is a description of what is in the rest of the document, without necessarily\ncontaining any of the key results. It's about 100 words long, usually one paragraph, and acts\nas an advert for the rest of the report. After reading the abstract, a potential reader should know\nwhether he wants to read the rest of the document or not.\nBoth executive summaries and abstracts get separated from the main report, so they must be\ncapable of standing alone. That means no references and no cross-references in either.\nIn most examples of an undergraduate or first-year postgraduate project report, I would suggest\nthat an executive summary is more appropriate.

While I wouldn’t\nentirely agree with that advice for presentations, it’s not a bad structure for a technical report.\nThe introduction is the chance to tell the readers what you're going to tell them.\nProbably the most common fault with introductions is that they go into too much detail, too\nfast, assume knowledge that the reader doesn’t have, and don’t put the report in context. A\nuseful visual image is that of a cone: the first paragraph of the introduction should be very\nbroad and understandable to “the man in the street” so that everyone can understand how the\nsubject of the report relates to something they are already familiar with. Then the following\nparagraphs should narrow the focus, explaining what part of the previous paragraph the report\nis concerned with, and why it is an interesting part of the wider problem.

[Previous experience.]\nIf the project has different strands (e.g. if software and hardware were developed essentially\nindependently), then these can be separated in different sections; otherwise I’d suggest writing\nthem in terms of the phases of the project: planning, implementing and testing, perhaps; or\nwhatever else seems appropriate. Each section, and each subsection of a report can be divided\nalong similar lines; this section of this report included. Of course, not all of the sections\nmentioned here will be relevant to every part of your report, but you might like to think about\nthem, or use them as a structure. When reporting on an actual experiment, I would expect to\nsee all of them. [Experiment design.]\nFor each section, it is often useful to consider exactly what you are trying to say. A lot of the\ntime you can use the structure:\na. Hypothesis/Purpose. First, state what you are trying to find out, or trying to do, as\nclearly as possible.\nb. Previous experience. Describe relevant information from the literature review, advice\ngained, and any other relevant facts.\nc. Experiment design. State how you designed the experiment, simulations, including\nwhat results would be considered to confirm the hypothesis, and what results would be\nexpected to reject it (with supporting maths if appropriate).\nd. Experiment execution. What happened when you tried to run the experiment, what\nwent wrong, what unexpected things happened (if any).\ne. Experiment results. Was the hypothesis confirmed or rejected?\nf. Conclusions. Including what you would have done better.\n[Experiment execution.]\nI’ve tried to divide this section of this report along the lines it describes. It’s not a perfect fit,\nsince I am not describing an experiment here. Nonetheless, I hope you can see how this section\nis structured. It’s useful to consider the structure of every document, and every section of a\ndocument, along these lines. It really does help the reader if there is a logical flow of ideas,\nrather than a whole series of facts and observations in no real order (or at least not in an order\nthat is clearly stated at the beginning).\nOf course, there are also parallels between the hypothesis/purpose to a section, and the\nintroduction to the whole report; and between the previous experience and the literature review\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n11\nVersion 6\nsections.

At the very least, the reference should have information about\nwhen you viewed the page.\nWikipedia is (sometimes) an exception: some articles are read (and corrected) by many people,\nwhich results in some information about technical subjects being quite good (although there\nare some exceptions). There are two golden rules for using Wikipedia as a reference source:\nalways read the “talk” pages so you are aware of any controversy and can check whether\nanyone else has reviewed the article; and reference the actual version of the web-page you are\nreading (Wikipedia helpfully keeps a historical record of all previous versions of articles). This\nis easy to do: in the “Tools” list on the left-margin menu, select the “Cite this page” menu item,\nthen choose whichever version fits into the referencing style you have chosen (Chicago is a\ngood one for engineering articles).\nAt this point, I should add that I don’t encourage people to use Wikipedia (or any other\nencyclopaedia) as a reference source, since it is not the original source of any information:\nanything in Wikipedia has been taken from other publications available elsewhere, and there\nmay have been an error in the process.\nIt’s much better to go to the original sources of the information (the ‘primary sources’) and\nread and reference them. However, Wikipedia is often a good place to start, and there are often\na good set of references at the end of the articles that are worth reading.\nSome examples of references in an acceptable and consistent style follow (there are lots more\nin\nthe\nreferencing\nstyle\nguides\ndocuments\navailable\nfrom\nhttps://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/referencing-style-guides/home.\n[1]\nG.\nMurray,\net\nal.,\n“LaTeX\nclass\nfile\nfor\nIEEE\npublications,”\nhttp://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/IEEEtran.cls,\n(accessed on September 17th 2004).\n5 There’s a useful guide to the IEEE style (and several other common styles) available from\nhttps://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/referencing-style-guides/home.\n6 Note that the citation (the [2]) is part of the sentence that it refers to and comes before the full-stop.

To get marks, we need to\nsee evidence for each of these things in the report. That means the format, presentation and\ngrammar have to be good, and that's quite straightforward to achieve; but it's less obvious how\nto provide evidence of \"ability to work alone\", or \"originality\".\nThese things have to be done indirectly: the last thing I want to read is a table listing all the\nideas you had during the course of the project, neatly summarised. The best way I know to do\nthis is to write the main sections of the report in almost a diary form: for example, \"the program\ndidn't compile, so it was suggested that the web be searched to see if someone else had come\nacross the same problem. After some time spent searching for help; a page of known compile\nbugs was found [1]9, which suggested the use of the linker's -qc option, and this then worked\".\nNow I know whose idea it was to try this option, who thought of looking on the web, and who\ndid the actual web-searching, and I can mark accordingly.\n(Personally, I don’t mind the use of the first person in writing reports, and the IEEE appear to\nagree with me [2], but I know a lot of my colleagues differ with me on this issue. I suggest\nyou check with your supervisors before starting to write. The safe option is to use the passive\ntense rather than the first person wherever possible, although this can make it difficult to\nidentify who did what, a particular problem in group projects. Some people use the “royal we”,\nbut I’d discourage this when you are referring to just yourself: reading sentences like “we\ninserted the disk into the machine” when all the fingers involved in the movement clearly\nbelonged to one person is just a little too silly. I can tolerate formality, but not at the cost of\naccuracy.)\nThe ability to plan is perhaps best demonstrated in a separate chapter of the report. One thing\nthat often separates 2.1 projects from 1st projects is the ability of the student to step outside the\nday-to-day linear task of just doing the project, and consider the project management aspects,\n9 This is a reference to the URL of the web-page of the bugs, so the reader can look up your sources if necessary.\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n16\nVersion 6\nand wider contexts as well. Why is the project being done? Who is going to be interested in\nit? What resources were available for the project? Were they sufficient? Could you have\nachieved more with more money? What was the original time-plan for the project, and was it\nfollowed? If not, why not, and how would you do things differently next time? Is it cost-\neffective? Has the project been worthwhile to you personally? What have you learned from\nit? Has it changed your impression of what it means to be an electronic engineer / researcher?\nOne other golden rule while I remember it: it must be obvious what you did, and what ideas\nyou had yourself and didn't find on a web-page or from another reference. (This is another\ndifference between a project report and a technical report: in a technical report no-one would\ncare whose idea it was, or who did what.)\nAnother golden rule while I’m at it, true for both project reports and technical reports: you\nshould always include enough detail about any experiments performed that another researcher\ncould come along and repeat your results."

            "text": "These really irritate me. Perhaps I am a bit too pedantic in this area, but I regard them as a sign\nof carelessness, and insufficient attention to detail. An engineer who is careless with details\nisn't much use to anyone: just overlooking a single point in a new design can render the whole\nproduct useless.\nFortunately, automatic spelling and grammar checkers have been getting much better over the\nlast year years, and can now spot most of the common problems. There is no excuse now for\nconfusing ‘its’ and ‘it’s’ or ‘their’, ‘there’ and ‘they’re’. (Although you shouldn’t be using\n‘they’re’ in any case – see the section on style.)\nWord’s spelling checker does a reasonable job, but I would recommend that Word users\ndownload and add in the free version of Grammarly (https://www.grammarly.com/) to check\ntheir grammar. This can pick up most of the common errors. Run this check frequently,\nespecially when you start writing, and you may find that it trains you to be a better writer,\nwhich saves time later on. (As with all grammar checkers, you may not always agree with its\nrecommendations, but the important thing is to know why you disagree10.)\n10 After having this report for nearly twenty years, when I first ran it through Grammarly’s checker it highlighted\n214 basic issues. Some of these were deliberate errors, some were Grammarly pointing out that some quotes I\nused were in American English, and some were pointing out that the grammar I was using was slightly old-\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n17\nVersion 6\nWhile tools such as Grammarly can be an enormous help, they are not a substitute for learning\nthe rules of grammar. Many issues raised by automatic grammar checkers are just suggestions\nor warnings – the tool has found an unusual sentence or word, and wants to draw your attention\nto it to check that there is no mistake. You should not just automatically change everything\nthat a grammar checker highlights as a potential problem.\nGetting someone else to proof-read your work is another useful technique to sort these out.\nAnother trick is to read your report out loud: that engages a different part of the brain in\ninterpreting the words, and you can spot errors that you had overlooked.\nGrammatical errors and malapropisms can be hard to spot. Some of the most common are\nlisted below.\n• 'it's' (with an apostrophe) is short for 'it is' or ‘it has’. 'its' (without an apostrophe) means\n'pertaining to it'. It's important to get this right; otherwise a document loses its credibility.\n• \"dependent\" is an adjective, it means something that relies on something else; \"dependant\"\nis a noun, referring to your children or aged relatives.\n• The “weather” report tells you “whether” to expect rain or not.\n• Hyphens separate parts of compound words (e.g. brick-red), and there is no space between\nthe words and the hyphen. If you put space around a hyphen (e.g. brick - red), it becomes\na dash. Dashes have a similar use to colons: they separate related phrases in the same\nsentence. Do not confuse the two.\n• \"effect\" and \"affect\". Both can be nouns and adjectives (so even grammar checkers have\ntrouble with these words), but unless you're a political journalist you are unlikely to use\neffect as a verb; and unless you're a psychologist, you're unlikely to use affect as a noun.\nI'm hoping to affect your report writing skills, and have an effect on your final mark.\n• “principal” is usually an adjective (although can also be a noun, especially in the US),\nreferring to something highest in rank or importance; “principle” is a noun referring to a\nlaw. “The principle of superposition was demonstrated by the principal engineer.”\n• “Discrete” means composed of individual separate parts (a discrete waveform); “discreet”\nmeans modest, or unobtrusive. A “discreet waveform” is then one that doesn’t draw\nattention to itself: a rather charming, if useless, concept.\n• “Compliment” means something nice someone said about you. “Complement” means\nsomething that makes something complete. I gave a compliment to the complement of\nstudents on my course.\n• Every sentence must a verb in it.\nfashioned (usual practice can change surprisingly fast, especially with things like the move from ‘proof read’\nthrough ‘proof-read’ to ‘proofread’). But a few were genuine mistakes that neither myself nor anyone who had\nread the document had apparently noticed.\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n18\nVersion 6\n• Try not to start sentences with \"so\", \"and\", \"but\", \"therefore\", \"moreover\" or \"however\".\nThese words are used to link two concepts or ideas; putting both concepts in the same\nsentence (perhaps with a semi-colon) helps establish this link.\n• (If an entire sentence is enclosed within brackets, the full stop comes within the brackets.)\nOtherwise, if a sentence starts before the open bracket, the full stop comes after the closing\nbracket (like this).\n• Semi-colons. There are many times when they are useful: separating items in lists;\nseparating items in a sentence that have their own internal commas; joining two complete\nsentences with very closely related contents.\n• Colons mean \"OK reader, here it comes\", and must follow what, up to the colon, has been\na complete sentence. You need many things to write a successful project report: style;\nsomething interesting to say; and these notes.\n• It's acceptable to occasionally split an infinitive when the alternative would be\ncumbersome.\n• kHz, please, not KHz or khz11; similarly for MHz. (It's always entertaining to read about\nprocessors running at 20 mHz, but it doesn't get many marks.) You might have to convince\nWord not to automatically ‘correct’ these for you; this can be done in the Tools/Auto-\ncorrect window.\n• I like the convention that there is a space between the number and the units \"3.4 kHz\", not\n\"3.4kHz\", but this is a matter of taste. The important thing is to be consistent. The problem\nwith this is when you get to the end of a line at the wrong point in the sentence, and get 3\nkHz, with the 3 on one line and the kHz on the next. This looks inelegant. There’s an easy\nway round this: don’t use a normal space between the 3 and the kHz, use a Ctrl-Shift-Space.\nWord won’t break a line on a Ctrl-Shift-Space. (The same is true for Ctrl-Shift-hyphens,\nWord won’t split a line on those, even though they otherwise look exactly like a normal\nhyphen.)\n• Fewer people, less noise. If you can count them, use “fewer”. If you can’t, use “less”.\nWhoever wrote the notice “eight items or less” sometimes found at supermarket checkouts\nis clearly illiterate.\n• License is a verb, licence is a noun. The magistrate granted a licence, licensing the licensee."

As steam-\ndriven companies became more visible in the eastern part of the country,\nthey changed farm hands into factory workers and provided jobs for the large\nwave of immigrants. With industry came the growth of large cities like Fall\nRiver where the Bordens lived which turned into centers of commerce and trade\nas well as production.\nWhat makes this passage plagiarism? The preceding passage is considered plagiarism for two\nreasons:\n•\nthe writer has only changed around a few words and phrases, or changed the order of\nthe original's sentences.\n•\nthe writer has failed to cite a source for any of the ideas or facts.\nIf you do either or both of these things, you are plagiarizing.\nNOTE: This paragraph is also problematic because it changes the sense of several sentences\n(for example, \"steam-driven companies\" in sentence two misses the original's emphasis on\nfactories).\nHere's an ACCEPTABLE paraphrase:\nFall River, where the Borden family lived, was typical of northeastern\nindustrial cities of the nineteenth century. Steam-powered production had\nshifted labor from agriculture to manufacturing, and as immigrants arrived\nin the US, they found work in these new factories. As a result, populations\ngrew, and large urban areas arose. Fall River was one of these manufacturing\nand commercial centers (Williams 1).\nWhy is this passage acceptable?\nThis is acceptable paraphrasing because the writer:\n•\naccurately relays the information in the original uses her own words.\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n21\nVersion 6\n•\nlets her reader know the source of her information.\nHere's an example of quotation and paraphrase used together, which is also\nACCEPTABLE:\nFall River, where the Borden family lived, was typical of northeastern\nindustrial cities of the nineteenth century.

In turn, growing populations increased the size of urban areas.\nFall River was one of these hubs \"which became the centers of production as\nwell as of commerce and trade\" (Williams 1).\nWhy is this passage acceptable?\nThis is acceptable paraphrasing because the writer:\n•\nrecords the information in the original passage accurately.\n•\ngives credit for the ideas in this passage.\n•\nindicated which part is taken directly from her source by putting the passage in\nquotation marks and citing the page number.\nNote that if the writer had used these phrases or sentences in her own paper without putting\nquotation marks around them, she would be PLAGIARIZING. Using another person's phrases\nor sentences without putting quotation marks around them is considered plagiarism EVEN IF\nTHE WRITER CITES IN HER OWN TEXT THE SOURCE OF THE PHRASES OR\nSENTENCES SHE HAS QUOTED.”\nNot only is that a very useful description of plagiarism, but it’s fine to include here, because\nI’ve said, right at the start, that I’ve taken the whole thing from the web, I’ve put the whole\nthing in inverted commas so the reader knows exactly where the quote ends and my own words\nstart again, and I’ve referenced it.

The way I do this is by defining an \"equation\" style\n(see the style sheet in this document for an example), which puts the equation number at the\nright-hand side, as most textbooks do, for example:\n𝑏 =\n𝑞3 \n∑𝑛 𝑥2\n[ 3.1 ]\nwhere b is referred to in italics in the text, as it appears in the equation itself. The Microsoft\nequation editor is capable of doing most things badly, and it can also put equations like 𝑏 = \n𝑎/𝑟 in a paragraph; but don’t put complex equations in paragraphs since you can't refer to\nthem by their reference number, and it upsets the spacing in the paragraph (notice the rather\nugly gap between the first and second lines in this paragraph).\nIt's not exactly obvious how to do this: a new type of caption has to be defined which is just an\nopen square bracket; the closing square bracket is then added manually, with a space to keep\nthe expression symmetrical. After inserting the caption, the whole line can be re-formatted in\na suitable \"equation\" style with tabs set to get the spacings correct.\nAnother way to do this is to put a one-row two-column table in the document, then put the\nequation in the left-hand box and the number in the right-hand box.\nEquations themselves can be done in the Microsoft equation editor, which should come as part\nof Word (though you might have to enable it). Go to the “Insert menu”, then look for the little\n‘π’ button.\n(Alternatively, if your budget allows, get hold of a copy of MathType: an extension to\nMicrosoft Word that makes equations look much better, and makes numbering, formatting and\ncross-referencing them simple. Microsoft Word’s built-in equation editor used to be a cut-\ndown version of this software, but sadly due to licensing issues Microsoft decided to replace\nthis very capable code with much less capable code of their own. Even more unfortunately,\nMathType appear to have taken advantage of this situation and have vastly increased the price\nof MathType to what is an unaffordable level for people like me.)\n12 ‘Features’ in the sense of ‘documented bugs’.\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n23\nVersion 6"

I don't know exactly what this means,\nbut it seems to have the highest success rate of any method I've tried so far. I then choose “in\nline with text” from the layout tab of the format picture dialogue window, and centre the picture\nin the page. That way it stays put: the alternative of using Word’s “intelligent” figure-\npositioning features can drive one mad when it keeps insisting on moving a picture somewhere\nyou don’t want it.\nYou can draw directly in Microsoft Word, but I've found this feature to be rather bug-ridden:\nthe PowerPoint drawing tools seem to be more reliable (which is odd, since they should be\nidentical). Pasting it as an Enhanced Metafile will attach the figure to the nearest paragraph\n(signified with an anchor sign when the figure is selected). You're then responsible for leaving\nenough space around the figure so that it fits, by adding blank lines (you can paste as an\nordinary Picture in which case Word will leave the space for you, however I've had problems\nwith some pictures trying this method).\nAll figures should be numbered and labelled (select the figure and use References->Insert\nCaption), with the label below the figure in question. The label should not be on the next page:\nsome paragraphs may have to be moved around to ensure this, usually after the report is\ncomplete.\nReferences to figures can be done using the ‘References->Cross-reference’ facility in Word\n(and this is a good idea since then the numbers stay in the correct order when you add or delete\nother figures) but just inserting a cross-reference to a figure ends up with something like ‘Figure\n3.1’. If you’re writing an IEEE paper, they will require the reference to be of the form ‘Fig\n3.1’ which Word can’t do. The only good solution I’ve found so far is to turn off Word’s\nhelpful automatic features and do it by hand.\nFigure 3.1 - An exciting green rectangle"

If you use one that doesn’t, it’s not a bad idea to run the .txt documents through Word\nat some point. (One good text editor for the PC that does include a spelling checker is TextPad,\nand a free evaluation version is available from http://www.textpad.com.) Otherwise the\ndocument will need very careful proof-reading.\nThe chances of finding a text-editor with a good built-in grammar checker are not high – in\nfact, I don’t know of one (please let me know if you find one). This is another good reason to\nrun the source text documents through Word before compiling them. You might not always\nagree with Word’s opinions on grammar, but it can pick up a lot of genuine errors that simple\nspelling checkers can miss. Again, the only alternative is very careful proof-reading, and it’s\nbetter to get someone else to do this if possible, someone who does not know the document\nwell already, and won’t read what they expect to be there, rather than what is there.\nWord automatically works out whether you want a ‘ or a ’ character from context, similarly, it\nsorts out the difference between “ and ”. LaTeX doesn’t – you have to tell it whether you want\na start quotes symbol by using the `` (two ASCII code 96 characters) or an end-quotes symbol\nusing ’’ (two ASCII code 39 characters).\n14 Which, by the way, is pronounced “lah-tech”.

It should save me about six or seven\nhours in talking to different students each year, and hopefully the same time again in making\ncomments on initial versions of reports. It'll also do a better job of communicating what I am\nexpecting in a project report, and I’m less likely to miss things out. So after two years, I should\nbe ahead in both quality and time.

A project report is not quite\nthe same as a technical report2, however it should show the same level of care and attention to\ndetail.\nThis document was written to provide a few pointers about what I look for in a project report,\nand some tips for writing these documents using Microsoft Word. It is written in the form it\nrecommends, and contains examples of both good and bad styles. It is intended for\nundergraduate project students, and post-graduate students in their first year. It assumes a\nreasonable familiarity with Microsoft Word (although not at the level of an expert user), and a\nreasonable grasp of English grammar.\nThis introduction chapter introduces this document, and contains some advice about writing\nreports for me to review.\n(You've now read the first couple of paragraphs of the introduction, and you should have a\ngood idea of what's in the rest of the document, whether you have the necessary background to\nbe able to understand it and might find it useful, and what's in the rest of this introduction\nchapter.

This is getting a bit tedious, and I find I often forget\nto mention something to one student, and a report then gets handed in at the end which isn't as\ngood as it could be. So I decided to put down my thoughts (or at least those of them that I\nremember as I write this) and distribute this document. Other thoughts will no doubt occur to\nme later, and this document will be updated as I remember them.\nPlease note that there is no accepted standard for project reports. Different supervisors will\nhave different opinions and preferences about style; in some cases this document merely\ndescribes my preferences and opinions (I will try to make clear when this happens). Any\nstudent reading this document would be well advised to talk to his or her other supervisor as\nwell, and attempt to write a document to satisfy us both.\nDistributing this report written in Word has two additional benefits: it allows me to give\nexamples of what I regard as good (and occasionally bad) styles, and it gives me the chance to\ndistribute a sample style gallery that might be of some use. (If you don't know what a style\ngallery is, look it up under Microsoft Word help.)\n2 At least, I don’t think it’s quite the same thing.

Strictly speaking you could\nargue that this section should be placed in the body of the report since it is not an introduction\nto anything that is discussed in more detail later, but since it’s short I can get away with it.\nI am happy to read draft copies of a report before submission. However, I am not happy to\nread slightly different versions of the same chapter over and over again, and I won’t have time\nto read anything if I am presented with a large document only a few days before the deadline.\nI have come up with a few rules for how this can best work for both of us:\n1) Run all chapters through a spelling and grammar checker before they get to me, and take\nnote of the advice provided. This is particularly important if English is not your first language.\nIf the grammar and spelling are so poor that I have difficulty in understanding what you are\ntrying to say, then be prepared to have the document returned. I’m afraid I don’t have the time\nor experience to teach English as a foreign language. (There are a lot of on-line grammar\ntutorials on the Internet, which you may benefit from, and other help is available in the\nUniversity;\nin\nparticular\ncontact\nthe\nUniversity’s\nWriting\nCentre\nhttps://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/skills/writing-centre/ for more advice.)\n2) Send me individual chapters one at a time, as soon as they are complete (or as soon as you\nwant some comments on them). This minimises the amount of reading I have to do at the end\nof the projects, and I hope will encourage you to write as you go along (which always a good\nidea).\nSadly, despite my best advice, every year some students leave their writing up to the last few\nweeks, then present me with a large document to review at the last minute. They are then\ndisappointed when I don’t have time to do this.\nI schedule the time to look at one chapter (or about 15 pages, whichever is shorter) every two\nweeks for each project student I have. At busy times, I will operate a queue system. I’m sorry\nabout this, but I really don’t have time to do anything more; and this rule will enable me to be\nfairer with the amount of help I can offer to different students.\n3) If you are sending me a chapter for the second time, then please make it clear where the\nchanges have been made, so I don’t have to read through everything again. (Try turning on\n‘Track Changes’ in Word, or do a comparison of the current version with the last version I\nlooked at, then mark the new sections, perhaps using colour.)\n4) If English is not your native language, it is almost certain that there will remain a lot of\ngrammatical and usage points which the computer’s grammar checker will not pick up.\nExperience has suggested that the best thing is to leave these until the end, and then for a native\nEnglish speaker to go through the document once to correct the grammar. It is better if this\nperson has not been involved with the project, so they don’t get too bored."

            "text": "The two most important things to do at the start: make a plan about how and when the report\nwill be written, and find out who your target audience is.\nAs far as the target audience is concerned: for the case of an undergraduate project report you\nshould be writing for any of your fellow students who are doing a completely different project.\nThis means you can assume any knowledge covered in the core courses, but not in any of the\noption modules. In the case of a first-year post-graduate report you are writing for someone\nwith the core knowledge of an electronic engineer, but no knowledge about your particular\nsubject area.\nThere is an exception to this rule, which occurs when the academic supervisor who has been\nassigned to you knows nothing about your subject area, not even what is taught in the core\ncourses (for example, in my case, this would happen when the project concerns\nnanotechnology, as I have no background in the subject area). It's always a good idea to check\nwith your academic supervisors (or whoever else might be reading the report) what their\nbackground is. In the case of a project about nanotechnology, I would appreciate an appendix\nwith an introduction to any concepts covered in the nanotechnology option modules which are\nnecessary to understand the main body of the report. (An appendix is an ideal place for\ninformation that only some of the readers of the document will require.)\n2.2\nPlanning and Top-down versus Bottom-up\nIn terms of how to write the report, just as with computer programs, reports can either be written\ntop-down (start with a list of chapter headings, then add the sub-headings, then write each\nsection individually); or bottom-up (just start writing, and then fit a structure around what\nyou've come up). And just like with computer programs, the best results usually come from a\ncombination of the two approaches. Top-down ensures that you don't leave any important\nsections out; bottom-up allows you to write freely, without thinking about what you should be\nsaying, and a more fluent and readable style can emerge.\nAnd please do write in a fluent, readable style. This isn't a technical report intended for\npublication to impress a client, this is a document that will be read by an academic over a\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n7\nVersion 6\nweekend, when he's probably got about seven others to read as well, and a dry ‘academic’ style\ncan be tedious to a point beyond the ability of the brain to tolerate. (This is one of my personal\npreferences: other academics may prefer a more formal, dryer style. I see no reason why\ntechnical documents should not be a joy to read; and I wish many more of them were.)\nIn terms of planning: as soon as you have an idea of what the project document is likely to\ncontain, I would recommend writing a top-down structure and setting a timescale for when\neach section will be completed. Any plan you come up is almost certain to change as the\nproject progresses, but it’s better to have a plan and change it than not to have a plan at all.\nThen, up to the last three or four weeks, I’d recommend working in a bottom-up style, just\nwriting about whatever interesting things have been going on at the time, and your current\nthoughts. As the project nears completion, these bits of writing can be fitted into the top-down\nstructure, and any gaps identified. It’s an iterative process (the top-level plan often changes\nwhen you find there’s very little to say about something), but I would strongly recommend\nmanaging the process, rather than just hoping things will fit together at the end."

Leaving all the writing up to the end never results in\na good report. This reflects one of the key differences between project reports and technical\nreports: a technical report is concerned with what has been done and what the results were; a\nproject report is more concerned with how you did it. It’s similar to the difference between\ndescribing the destination and describing the journey. Remember, we are trying to give you a\nmark for all the work you did throughout the project (including the problems, bugs and dead\nends) on the basis of a single document handed it at the end. In fact, we're more interested in\nthe problems and bugs (and how you dealt with them) than in the final result.\nLeave all the writing to the end, and you will forget about some of the more frustrating bugs\nyou found, the irritating problems you had, and all the things you tried before you finally found\na solution. Yet these attempts, ideas and frustrations are exactly what we want to read about.\nThere are marks available for having inventive ideas and problem solving, but we need\nevidence to award these marks: please let us give them to you.\nThis is also one of the benefits of sending weekly emails with current progress, issues and\nconcerns. They can be used as a memory-jogger if the relevant sections of the report are not\nbeing written up as you go along. Another benefit is that they provide a diary of events that\ncan be used to plot progress against the project plan."

An abstract is a description of what is in the rest of the document, without necessarily\ncontaining any of the key results. It's about 100 words long, usually one paragraph, and acts\nas an advert for the rest of the report. After reading the abstract, a potential reader should know\nwhether he wants to read the rest of the document or not.\nBoth executive summaries and abstracts get separated from the main report, so they must be\ncapable of standing alone. That means no references and no cross-references in either.\nIn most examples of an undergraduate or first-year postgraduate project report, I would suggest\nthat an executive summary is more appropriate.

While I wouldn’t\nentirely agree with that advice for presentations, it’s not a bad structure for a technical report.\nThe introduction is the chance to tell the readers what you're going to tell them.\nProbably the most common fault with introductions is that they go into too much detail, too\nfast, assume knowledge that the reader doesn’t have, and don’t put the report in context. A\nuseful visual image is that of a cone: the first paragraph of the introduction should be very\nbroad and understandable to “the man in the street” so that everyone can understand how the\nsubject of the report relates to something they are already familiar with. Then the following\nparagraphs should narrow the focus, explaining what part of the previous paragraph the report\nis concerned with, and why it is an interesting part of the wider problem.

[Previous experience.]\nIf the project has different strands (e.g. if software and hardware were developed essentially\nindependently), then these can be separated in different sections; otherwise I’d suggest writing\nthem in terms of the phases of the project: planning, implementing and testing, perhaps; or\nwhatever else seems appropriate. Each section, and each subsection of a report can be divided\nalong similar lines; this section of this report included. Of course, not all of the sections\nmentioned here will be relevant to every part of your report, but you might like to think about\nthem, or use them as a structure. When reporting on an actual experiment, I would expect to\nsee all of them. [Experiment design.]\nFor each section, it is often useful to consider exactly what you are trying to say. A lot of the\ntime you can use the structure:\na. Hypothesis/Purpose. First, state what you are trying to find out, or trying to do, as\nclearly as possible.\nb. Previous experience. Describe relevant information from the literature review, advice\ngained, and any other relevant facts.\nc. Experiment design. State how you designed the experiment, simulations, including\nwhat results would be considered to confirm the hypothesis, and what results would be\nexpected to reject it (with supporting maths if appropriate).\nd. Experiment execution. What happened when you tried to run the experiment, what\nwent wrong, what unexpected things happened (if any).\ne. Experiment results.

It’s not a perfect fit,\nsince I am not describing an experiment here. Nonetheless, I hope you can see how this section\nis structured. It’s useful to consider the structure of every document, and every section of a\ndocument, along these lines. It really does help the reader if there is a logical flow of ideas,\nrather than a whole series of facts and observations in no real order (or at least not in an order\nthat is clearly stated at the beginning).\nOf course, there are also parallels between the hypothesis/purpose to a section, and the\nintroduction to the whole report; and between the previous experience and the literature review\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n11\nVersion 6\nsections.

The golden rule\nabout references is that they should contain enough information for the reader to easily find the\noriginal sources without using a search engine. For a technical paper this means name of\nauthor(s), title of paper, journal or magazine title, date of publication, volume number and page\nreferences; for a book this means name of author(s), title of book, edition, date of publication\nand publisher. For a web-site, just the URL and the date you accessed it might be all you have,\nalthough most web-pages have titles, and if you know the name of the author then include that\nas well.\n4 The author of a useful guide on writing reports, perhaps?\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n12\nVersion 6\nAll academic publishers have their own set of (very strict) guidelines about the format of\nreferences. Unfortunately, they do not agree: the IEEE style is not the same as the IET style,\nand the Kluwer style differs again. The important thing is to be consistent. You could do\nworse than adopt the IEEE style5 [2]6. This includes such details as the titles of books of papers,\nconference proceedings or journals should be in italics, and the authors initials and surname\nshould precede the title, which is placed in quotation marks. Book titles should be followed by\nthe edition number, publishers and publication year; journal titles by the volume, page numbers\nand date7.\nWeb-pages are usually not good references for two reasons: firstly many web-pages are not\npeer-reviewed and have not been edited for accuracy so the information is not reliable; and\nsecondly web-pages can change at any time, and anyone looking at your reference might not\nsee the same thing that you saw. At the very least, the reference should have information about\nwhen you viewed the page.\nWikipedia is (sometimes) an exception: some articles are read (and corrected) by many people,\nwhich results in some information about technical subjects being quite good (although there\nare some exceptions). There are two golden rules for using Wikipedia as a reference source:\nalways read the “talk” pages so you are aware of any controversy and can check whether\nanyone else has reviewed the article; and reference the actual version of the web-page you are\nreading (Wikipedia helpfully keeps a historical record of all previous versions of articles). This\nis easy to do: in the “Tools” list on the left-margin menu, select the “Cite this page” menu item,\nthen choose whichever version fits into the referencing style you have chosen (Chicago is a\ngood one for engineering articles).\nAt this point, I should add that I don’t encourage people to use Wikipedia (or any other\nencyclopaedia) as a reference source, since it is not the original source of any information:\nanything in Wikipedia has been taken from other publications available elsewhere, and there\nmay have been an error in the process.\nIt’s much better to go to the original sources of the information (the ‘primary sources’) and\nread and reference them. However, Wikipedia is often a good place to start, and there are often\na good set of references at the end of the articles that are worth reading.\nSome examples of references in an acceptable and consistent style follow (there are lots more\nin\nthe\nreferencing\nstyle\nguides\ndocuments\navailable\nfrom\nhttps://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/referencing-style-guides/home.\n[1]\nG.\nMurray,\net\nal.,\n“LaTeX\nclass\nfile\nfor\nIEEE\npublications,”\nhttp://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/IEEEtran.cls,\n(accessed on September 17th 2004).\n5 There’s a useful guide to the IEEE style (and several other common styles) available from\nhttps://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/referencing-style-guides/home.\n6 Note that the citation (the [2]) is part of the sentence that it refers to and comes before the full-stop.

To get marks, we need to\nsee evidence for each of these things in the report. That means the format, presentation and\ngrammar have to be good, and that's quite straightforward to achieve; but it's less obvious how\nto provide evidence of \"ability to work alone\", or \"originality\".\nThese things have to be done indirectly: the last thing I want to read is a table listing all the\nideas you had during the course of the project, neatly summarised. The best way I know to do\nthis is to write the main sections of the report in almost a diary form: for example, \"the program\ndidn't compile, so it was suggested that the web be searched to see if someone else had come\nacross the same problem. After some time spent searching for help; a page of known compile\nbugs was found [1]9, which suggested the use of the linker's -qc option, and this then worked\".\nNow I know whose idea it was to try this option, who thought of looking on the web, and who\ndid the actual web-searching, and I can mark accordingly.\n(Personally, I don’t mind the use of the first person in writing reports, and the IEEE appear to\nagree with me [2], but I know a lot of my colleagues differ with me on this issue. I suggest\nyou check with your supervisors before starting to write. The safe option is to use the passive\ntense rather than the first person wherever possible, although this can make it difficult to\nidentify who did what, a particular problem in group projects. Some people use the “royal we”,\nbut I’d discourage this when you are referring to just yourself: reading sentences like “we\ninserted the disk into the machine” when all the fingers involved in the movement clearly\nbelonged to one person is just a little too silly. I can tolerate formality, but not at the cost of\naccuracy.)\nThe ability to plan is perhaps best demonstrated in a separate chapter of the report. One thing\nthat often separates 2.1 projects from 1st projects is the ability of the student to step outside the\nday-to-day linear task of just doing the project, and consider the project management aspects,\n9 This is a reference to the URL of the web-page of the bugs, so the reader can look up your sources if necessary.\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n16\nVersion 6\nand wider contexts as well. Why is the project being done? Who is going to be interested in\nit? What resources were available for the project? Were they sufficient? Could you have\nachieved more with more money? What was the original time-plan for the project, and was it\nfollowed? If not, why not, and how would you do things differently next time? Is it cost-\neffective? Has the project been worthwhile to you personally? What have you learned from\nit? Has it changed your impression of what it means to be an electronic engineer / researcher?\nOne other golden rule while I remember it: it must be obvious what you did, and what ideas\nyou had yourself and didn't find on a web-page or from another reference. (This is another\ndifference between a project report and a technical report: in a technical report no-one would\ncare whose idea it was, or who did what.)\nAnother golden rule while I’m at it, true for both project reports and technical reports: you\nshould always include enough detail about any experiments performed that another researcher\ncould come along and repeat your results."

An engineer who is careless with details\nisn't much use to anyone: just overlooking a single point in a new design can render the whole\nproduct useless.\nFortunately, automatic spelling and grammar checkers have been getting much better over the\nlast year years, and can now spot most of the common problems. There is no excuse now for\nconfusing ‘its’ and ‘it’s’ or ‘their’, ‘there’ and ‘they’re’. (Although you shouldn’t be using\n‘they’re’ in any case – see the section on style.)\nWord’s spelling checker does a reasonable job, but I would recommend that Word users\ndownload and add in the free version of Grammarly (https://www.grammarly.com/) to check\ntheir grammar. This can pick up most of the common errors. Run this check frequently,\nespecially when you start writing, and you may find that it trains you to be a better writer,\nwhich saves time later on. (As with all grammar checkers, you may not always agree with its\nrecommendations, but the important thing is to know why you disagree10.)\n10 After having this report for nearly twenty years, when I first ran it through Grammarly’s checker it highlighted\n214 basic issues. Some of these were deliberate errors, some were Grammarly pointing out that some quotes I\nused were in American English, and some were pointing out that the grammar I was using was slightly old-\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n17\nVersion 6\nWhile tools such as Grammarly can be an enormous help, they are not a substitute for learning\nthe rules of grammar. Many issues raised by automatic grammar checkers are just suggestions\nor warnings – the tool has found an unusual sentence or word, and wants to draw your attention\nto it to check that there is no mistake. You should not just automatically change everything\nthat a grammar checker highlights as a potential problem.\nGetting someone else to proof-read your work is another useful technique to sort these out.\nAnother trick is to read your report out loud: that engages a different part of the brain in\ninterpreting the words, and you can spot errors that you had overlooked.\nGrammatical errors and malapropisms can be hard to spot. Some of the most common are\nlisted below.\n• 'it's' (with an apostrophe) is short for 'it is' or ‘it has’. 'its' (without an apostrophe) means\n'pertaining to it'. It's important to get this right; otherwise a document loses its credibility.\n• \"dependent\" is an adjective, it means something that relies on something else; \"dependant\"\nis a noun, referring to your children or aged relatives.\n• The “weather” report tells you “whether” to expect rain or not.\n• Hyphens separate parts of compound words (e.g. brick-red), and there is no space between\nthe words and the hyphen. If you put space around a hyphen (e.g. brick - red), it becomes\na dash. Dashes have a similar use to colons: they separate related phrases in the same\nsentence. Do not confuse the two.\n• \"effect\" and \"affect\". Both can be nouns and adjectives (so even grammar checkers have\ntrouble with these words), but unless you're a political journalist you are unlikely to use\neffect as a verb; and unless you're a psychologist, you're unlikely to use affect as a noun.\nI'm hoping to affect your report writing skills, and have an effect on your final mark.\n• “principal” is usually an adjective (although can also be a noun, especially in the US),\nreferring to something highest in rank or importance; “principle” is a noun referring to a\nlaw. “The principle of superposition was demonstrated by the principal engineer.”\n• “Discrete” means composed of individual separate parts (a discrete waveform); “discreet”\nmeans modest, or unobtrusive. A “discreet waveform” is then one that doesn’t draw\nattention to itself: a rather charming, if useless, concept.\n• “Compliment” means something nice someone said about you. “Complement” means\nsomething that makes something complete. I gave a compliment to the complement of\nstudents on my course.\n• Every sentence must a verb in it.\nfashioned (usual practice can change surprisingly fast, especially with things like the move from ‘proof read’\nthrough ‘proof-read’ to ‘proofread’). But a few were genuine mistakes that neither myself nor anyone who had\nread the document had apparently noticed.\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n18\nVersion 6\n• Try not to start sentences with \"so\", \"and\", \"but\", \"therefore\", \"moreover\" or \"however\".\nThese words are used to link two concepts or ideas; putting both concepts in the same\nsentence (perhaps with a semi-colon) helps establish this link.\n• (If an entire sentence is enclosed within brackets, the full stop comes within the brackets.)\nOtherwise, if a sentence starts before the open bracket, the full stop comes after the closing\nbracket (like this).\n• Semi-colons. There are many times when they are useful: separating items in lists;\nseparating items in a sentence that have their own internal commas; joining two complete\nsentences with very closely related contents.\n• Colons mean \"OK reader, here it comes\", and must follow what, up to the colon, has been\na complete sentence. You need many things to write a successful project report: style;\nsomething interesting to say; and these notes.\n• It's acceptable to occasionally split an infinitive when the alternative would be\ncumbersome.\n• kHz, please, not KHz or khz11; similarly for MHz. (It's always entertaining to read about\nprocessors running at 20 mHz, but it doesn't get many marks.) You might have to convince\nWord not to automatically ‘correct’ these for you; this can be done in the Tools/Auto-\ncorrect window.\n• I like the convention that there is a space between the number and the units \"3.4 kHz\", not\n\"3.4kHz\", but this is a matter of taste. The important thing is to be consistent. The problem\nwith this is when you get to the end of a line at the wrong point in the sentence, and get 3\nkHz, with the 3 on one line and the kHz on the next. This looks inelegant. There’s an easy\nway round this: don’t use a normal space between the 3 and the kHz, use a Ctrl-Shift-Space.\nWord won’t break a line on a Ctrl-Shift-Space. (The same is true for Ctrl-Shift-hyphens,\nWord won’t split a line on those, even though they otherwise look exactly like a normal\nhyphen.)\n• Fewer people, less noise. If you can count them, use “fewer”. If you can’t, use “less”.\nWhoever wrote the notice “eight items or less” sometimes found at supermarket checkouts\nis clearly illiterate.\n• License is a verb, licence is a noun. The magistrate granted a licence, licensing the licensee."

            "text": "I found a useful example from America, which I’ve taken from the web-pages of the university\nof Indiana, and reproduce here in its entirety [4].\n“Here's the ORIGINAL text, from page 1 of Lizzie Borden: A Case Book of Family and Crime\nin the 1890s by Joyce Williams et al.:\nThe rise of industry, the growth of cities, and the expansion of the population were the three\ngreat developments of late nineteenth century American history. As new, larger, steam-\npowered factories became a feature of the American landscape in the East, they transformed\nfarm hands into industrial laborers, and provided jobs for a rising tide of immigrants. With\nindustry came urbanization the growth of large cities (like Fall River, Massachusetts, where\nthe Bordens lived) which became the centers of production as well as of commerce and trade.\nHere's an UNACCEPTABLE paraphrase that is plagiarism:\nThe increase of industry, the growth of cities, and the explosion of the\npopulation were three large factors of nineteenth century America. As steam-\ndriven companies became more visible in the eastern part of the country,\nthey changed farm hands into factory workers and provided jobs for the large\nwave of immigrants. With industry came the growth of large cities like Fall\nRiver where the Bordens lived which turned into centers of commerce and trade\nas well as production.\nWhat makes this passage plagiarism? The preceding passage is considered plagiarism for two\nreasons:\n•\nthe writer has only changed around a few words and phrases, or changed the order of\nthe original's sentences.\n•\nthe writer has failed to cite a source for any of the ideas or facts.\nIf you do either or both of these things, you are plagiarizing.\nNOTE: This paragraph is also problematic because it changes the sense of several sentences\n(for example, \"steam-driven companies\" in sentence two misses the original's emphasis on\nfactories).\nHere's an ACCEPTABLE paraphrase:\nFall River, where the Borden family lived, was typical of northeastern\nindustrial cities of the nineteenth century. Steam-powered production had\nshifted labor from agriculture to manufacturing, and as immigrants arrived\nin the US, they found work in these new factories. As a result, populations\ngrew, and large urban areas arose. Fall River was one of these manufacturing\nand commercial centers (Williams 1).\nWhy is this passage acceptable?\nThis is acceptable paraphrasing because the writer:\n•\naccurately relays the information in the original uses her own words.\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n21\nVersion 6\n•\nlets her reader know the source of her information.\nHere's an example of quotation and paraphrase used together, which is also\nACCEPTABLE:\nFall River, where the Borden family lived, was typical of northeastern\nindustrial cities of the nineteenth century. As steam-powered production\nshifted labor from agriculture to manufacturing, the demand for workers\n\"transformed farm hands into industrial laborers,\" and created jobs for\nimmigrants. In turn, growing populations increased the size of urban areas.\nFall River was one of these hubs \"which became the centers of production as\nwell as of commerce and trade\" (Williams 1).\nWhy is this passage acceptable?\nThis is acceptable paraphrasing because the writer:\n•\nrecords the information in the original passage accurately.\n•\ngives credit for the ideas in this passage.\n•\nindicated which part is taken directly from her source by putting the passage in\nquotation marks and citing the page number.\nNote that if the writer had used these phrases or sentences in her own paper without putting\nquotation marks around them, she would be PLAGIARIZING. Using another person's phrases\nor sentences without putting quotation marks around them is considered plagiarism EVEN IF\nTHE WRITER CITES IN HER OWN TEXT THE SOURCE OF THE PHRASES OR\nSENTENCES SHE HAS QUOTED.”\nNot only is that a very useful description of plagiarism, but it’s fine to include here, because\nI’ve said, right at the start, that I’ve taken the whole thing from the web, I’ve put the whole\nthing in inverted commas so the reader knows exactly where the quote ends and my own words\nstart again, and I’ve referenced it. If I had failed to do any of these things, I could be heavily\npenalised.\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n22\nVersion 6"

            "text": "Equations should always be numbered. The way I do this is by defining an \"equation\" style\n(see the style sheet in this document for an example), which puts the equation number at the\nright-hand side, as most textbooks do, for example:\n𝑏 =\n𝑞3 \n∑𝑛 𝑥2\n[ 3.1 ]\nwhere b is referred to in italics in the text, as it appears in the equation itself. The Microsoft\nequation editor is capable of doing most things badly, and it can also put equations like 𝑏 = \n𝑎/𝑟 in a paragraph; but don’t put complex equations in paragraphs since you can't refer to\nthem by their reference number, and it upsets the spacing in the paragraph (notice the rather\nugly gap between the first and second lines in this paragraph).\nIt's not exactly obvious how to do this: a new type of caption has to be defined which is just an\nopen square bracket; the closing square bracket is then added manually, with a space to keep\nthe expression symmetrical. After inserting the caption, the whole line can be re-formatted in\na suitable \"equation\" style with tabs set to get the spacings correct.\nAnother way to do this is to put a one-row two-column table in the document, then put the\nequation in the left-hand box and the number in the right-hand box.\nEquations themselves can be done in the Microsoft equation editor, which should come as part\nof Word (though you might have to enable it). Go to the “Insert menu”, then look for the little\n‘π’ button.\n(Alternatively, if your budget allows, get hold of a copy of MathType: an extension to\nMicrosoft Word that makes equations look much better, and makes numbering, formatting and\ncross-referencing them simple. Microsoft Word’s built-in equation editor used to be a cut-\ndown version of this software, but sadly due to licensing issues Microsoft decided to replace\nthis very capable code with much less capable code of their own. Even more unfortunately,\nMathType appear to have taken advantage of this situation and have vastly increased the price\nof MathType to what is an unaffordable level for people like me.)\n12 ‘Features’ in the sense of ‘documented bugs’.\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n23\nVersion 6"

I don't know exactly what this means,\nbut it seems to have the highest success rate of any method I've tried so far. I then choose “in\nline with text” from the layout tab of the format picture dialogue window, and centre the picture\nin the page. That way it stays put: the alternative of using Word’s “intelligent” figure-\npositioning features can drive one mad when it keeps insisting on moving a picture somewhere\nyou don’t want it.\nYou can draw directly in Microsoft Word, but I've found this feature to be rather bug-ridden:\nthe PowerPoint drawing tools seem to be more reliable (which is odd, since they should be\nidentical). Pasting it as an Enhanced Metafile will attach the figure to the nearest paragraph\n(signified with an anchor sign when the figure is selected). You're then responsible for leaving\nenough space around the figure so that it fits, by adding blank lines (you can paste as an\nordinary Picture in which case Word will leave the space for you, however I've had problems\nwith some pictures trying this method).\nAll figures should be numbered and labelled (select the figure and use References->Insert\nCaption), with the label below the figure in question. The label should not be on the next page:\nsome paragraphs may have to be moved around to ensure this, usually after the report is\ncomplete.\nReferences to figures can be done using the ‘References->Cross-reference’ facility in Word\n(and this is a good idea since then the numbers stay in the correct order when you add or delete\nother figures) but just inserting a cross-reference to a figure ends up with something like ‘Figure\n3.1’. If you’re writing an IEEE paper, they will require the reference to be of the form ‘Fig\n3.1’ which Word can’t do. The only good solution I’ve found so far is to turn off Word’s\nhelpful automatic features and do it by hand.\nFigure 3.1 - An exciting green rectangle"

This\nallows Powerpoint to change the spacings, font sizes, and line widths in the graph, which is not\neasy in MATLAB. If a dotted line is drawn in MATLAB, then “tracing” over it with a\nPowerpoint curve, then deleting the original MATLAB line and re-formatting the curve to\nwhatever colour and width are required can drastically reduce the amount of memory required\nto store the figure, and make the resultant document more reliable (Word has a habit of doing\nstrange things when it runs out of memory).\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n24\nVersion 6"

If you use one that doesn’t, it’s not a bad idea to run the .txt documents through Word\nat some point. (One good text editor for the PC that does include a spelling checker is TextPad,\nand a free evaluation version is available from http://www.textpad.com.) Otherwise the\ndocument will need very careful proof-reading.\nThe chances of finding a text-editor with a good built-in grammar checker are not high – in\nfact, I don’t know of one (please let me know if you find one). This is another good reason to\nrun the source text documents through Word before compiling them. You might not always\nagree with Word’s opinions on grammar, but it can pick up a lot of genuine errors that simple\nspelling checkers can miss. Again, the only alternative is very careful proof-reading, and it’s\nbetter to get someone else to do this if possible, someone who does not know the document\nwell already, and won’t read what they expect to be there, rather than what is there.\nWord automatically works out whether you want a ‘ or a ’ character from context, similarly, it\nsorts out the difference between “ and ”. LaTeX doesn’t – you have to tell it whether you want\na start quotes symbol by using the `` (two ASCII code 96 characters) or an end-quotes symbol\nusing ’’ (two ASCII code 39 characters).\n14 Which, by the way, is pronounced “lah-tech”. The character at the end of the word is a capital Greek chi, not\nan upper-case X.\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n27\nVersion 6\nWatch out for ‘\\’ and ‘%’ signs in the text as well. ‘\\’ is a LaTeX escape character: if you want\na ‘\\’ to appear in your report, you’ll need to write ‘\\\\/’. ‘%’ is a LaTeX comment: the rest of\nthe input line will be ignored.

            "text": "This happens a lot. I often read things like “the capacity of the link is then:\nC =\n\n\ni\n\nW log2 det  I −\nH \n\n\n\n[ 5.1 ]\nwhere H is the channel matrix.”\nFine, but what is W? What is ? What is ? If you write an equation you have to\nclearly state what all the terms in the equation represent. Otherwise it’s useless.\n5.12Writing something in the report you don’t understand\nI can see how tempting this might be to do. If you just can’t get your head around a\nderivation or a proof, you just copy it from a textbook into your report. However, this\nis very dangerous. We’ll probably ask you about it in the viva, and if you can’t explain\nsomething in your report, it really doesn’t look good. It’s much better just to quote the\nresult and add a reference to where the derivation comes from. Writing anything is a\nclaim that you understand it (unless you put it in quotes, so it’s obviously not your own\nwords).\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n30\nVersion 6"

        "text": "This report was written for undergraduate and first-year postgraduate students to help answer\nthe perennial questions of what a project report should contain, how they are marked and how\nsuitable reports can be generated in Microsoft Word.15\nAll feedback is very welcome - let me know what you found useful, and what you found not-\nso-useful, and what additional information you would have liked to be included in future\nversions. Inevitably, I haven't thought of all the issues and common problems in report writing,\nbut I will maintain this document and include any issues I spot during the marking of the next\nset of project reports.\nI estimate it took about three days, in all, to write this. It should save me about six or seven\nhours in talking to different students each year, and hopefully the same time again in making\ncomments on initial versions of reports. It'll also do a better job of communicating what I am\nexpecting in a project report, and I’m less likely to miss things out. So after two years, I should\nbe ahead in both quality and time. Or at least that's the plan. Do tell me what you think.\n15 That's the \"tell 'em what you told 'em\" bit.\nProject Reports\nHow To Write Project Reports in Microsoft Word and LaTeX\n© 2002-22 University of York\n31\nVersion 6",
